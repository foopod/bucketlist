Wordpress theme for Athena's [website](http://herlist.online)

This thing is based on Poole's Jekyll theme [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde), so the CSS is borrowed from there, with numerous changes for custom bits and bobs and wordpress elements (like comments).

This is my first wordpress theme, so not only is it probably really bad, but you can't customize it like other themes. But hey, lets see where this goes...

Cheers,
